Minimalist UI. Looking to cater to an adult audience, so I kept the site simple and clean. Doing so I used the agreed upon colors and the hex codes are in the veriables. I used a less compiler for the css. The site is responsive at 500px, 700px (800px works great at these settings), 1000px, and 4000px. The site will look good on most screens from the IPhone 5 up to a 4K monitor.
